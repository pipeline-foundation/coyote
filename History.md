## v1.7.3
- Added support for the `net7.0` target framework.

## v1.7.2
- Added support for fully controlling the `SemaphoreSlim` type during testing.
- Added support for detecting the `System.Guid` and `System.DateTime` APIs as sources of
  uncontrolled data non-determinism during testing.
- Added the `Configuration.WithPartiallyControlledDataNondeterminismAllowed` API (and
  `--partial-control <MODE>` CLI option) for configuring how uncontrolled data non-determinism
  should be handled during testing.
- Added the `Configuration.WithScheduleCoverageReported` API (and `--schedule-coverage` CLI option)
  for dumping coverage statistics and stack traces for scheduling decisions.
- Added the `Specification.RegisterStateHashingFunction` API for registering custom program state
  hashing functions, which can be used to compute an approximation of the program state during
  testing, as well as reporting it in the test statistics.
- Improved replay traces by registering the scheduling point type alongside each scheduling
  decision.
- Fixed missing `net462` dependency in the `Microsoft.Coyote.Tool` NuGet package.

## v1.7.1
- Added support for operation grouping for `Task` continuations.
- Added support for the delay-bounding exploration strategy.
- Added support for rewriting the `Thread.Yield` and `Interlocked` APIs.
- Updated the runtime to not fail with a potential deadlock when the debugger is attached, and
  instead add a breakpoint, to avoid spurious failures when debugging.
- Hardened the `SchedulingPoint.Suppress` and `SchedulingPoint.Resume` methods so that they do not
  resume scheduling earlier than expected when they are used in a nested manner.
- Fixed a runtime memory leak when test iterations terminated early.
- Fixed a rare stack-overflow exception when popping states during a `StateMachine` execution.
- Fixed a few cases of internally spawned tasks considered to be uncontrolled by the runtime.

## v1.7.0
- Updated the default `random` exploration strategy with a `portfolio` testing mode that uses a
  tuned set of different exploration strategies to increase coverage for different bug patterns. The
  portfolio will be transparently enhanced over time as new exploration strategies become available
  inside Coyote. The Portfolio can be set to fair or unfair using `Configuration.WithPortfolioMode`
  or the `--portfolio-mode` command-line option. The portfolio mode can be disabled and explicitly
  set to one of the available exploration strategies by setting a strategy-related option such as
  `Configuration.WithRandomStrategy` or `-s <STRATEGY>`.
- Refactored the NuGet packages, by moving `Microsoft.Coyote.Actors` to its own dedicated package,
  introducing a new `Microsoft.Coyote.Tool` package that contains the self-contained `coyote`
  command-line tool (for users that do not want to manage `coyote` via the `Microsoft.Coyote.CLI`
  .NET tool), introducing a new `Microsoft.Coyote.Core` package that only contains the core runtime
  library of Coyote, and converting the `Microsoft.Coyote` NuGet package into a meta-package that
  pulls all non-tool packages.
- Moved the actor `Event` type under the `Microsoft.Coyote.Actors` namespace.
- Introduced a `Monitor.Event` type (nested in the `Microsoft.Coyote.Specifications.Monitor` class),
  which must now be used for declaring specification monitor events, instead of the original `Event`
  type above.
- Enhanced and streamlined the logging API and built-in loggers, which are now available in the
  `Microsoft.Coyote.Logging` namespace, instead of `Microsoft.Coyote.IO`.
- Removed support for the end-of-life `net5.0` target framework.

## v1.6.2
- Exposed new `IActorRuntime.GetCurrentActorIds()` API that returns the `ActorId` for each active
  actor managed by the runtime, as well as an `IActorRuntime.GetCurrentActorTypes()` API that
  returns the `Type` of each active actor managed by the runtime. These APIs are not thread-safe and
  should only be used for gathering statistics and debugging purposes.

## v1.6.1
- Exposed new `IActorRuntime.GetActorExecutionStatus(id)` API that enables querying the actor
  runtime for the current execution status of the actor with the specified id, as well as an
  `IActorRuntime.GetCurrentActorCount()` API that returns the number of active actors managed by the
  runtime. These APIs are not thread-safe and should only be used for gathering statistics and
  debugging purposes.
- Exposed new `IActorRuntime.OnActorHalted` callback which is triggered when an actor has halted and
  the runtime has stopped managing it.

## v1.6.0
- Exposed new `Operation` API that enables instrumenting, controlling and scheduling custom
concurrent operations.
- Exposed new `SchedulingPoint.SetCheckpoint` API that allows to capture all non-deterministic
  decisions in the currently explored execution path and try replay them in subsequent test
  iterations to optimize coverage of a subset of the state space.
- Added support for intercepting and controlling asynchronous locks.
- Added support for rewriting the `SemaphoreSlim` type.
- The `Configuration.WithReplayStrategy` method was renamed to `Configuration.WithReproducibleTrace`
  to make it more explicit that setting this option allows reproducing the specified trace.
- Various runtime improvements and bug fixes.

## v1.5.9
- Improved the runtime to try enforce atomicity when invoking a specification `Monitor`.

## v1.5.8
- Fixed a bug in `coyote rewrite` related to rewriting nested types.

## v1.5.7

  generic return type.

## v1.5.5
- Added support in `coyote rewrite` for rewriting types with a required modifier (`modreq`).

## v1.5.4
- Significantly improved runtime performance during partially-controlled concurrency testing.

## v1.5.3
- Improved the assembly loading logic when using the `coyote` tool.
- Fixed rare deadlock in test execution paths that exhibit partially-controlled concurrency.
- Various other runtime improvements.

## v1.5.2
- Introduced new command-line interface for the `coyote` tool that builds on top of the
  `System.CommandLine` library. This brings an improved and more robust user experience (e.g. better
  CLI error messages), as well as other enhancements such as CLI option grouping.
- The `--coverage code` CLI option is not supported anymore as it was only supported on Windows and
  has been superseded by the official .NET cross-platform code coverage infrastructure. See
  [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/additional-tools/dotnet-coverage) and
  [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/testing/unit-testing-code-coverage?tabs=windows).
  The `--coverage` (or `-c`) CLI option is now used to enable activity coverage (replacing
  `--coverage activity`), as discussed [here](https://microsoft.github.io/coyote/#how-to/coverage).
- The `--parallel N` CLI option is not supported anymore to bring the `coyote` tool experience in
  line with the programmatic way of running Coyote tests (via the `TestingEngine` API), which did
  not support built-in parallel testing. If needed, running parallel tests can still be achieved by
  invoking multiple Coyote testing processes in parallel (e.g. via a script).

## v1.5.1
- Simplified the `coyote` tool ASP.NET dependency.
- Partially controlled concurrency is now allowed by default during systematic testing. Disable via
  the `--no-partial-control` command line option (or
  `Configuration.WithPartiallyControlledConcurrencyAllowed(false)`).

  `--reduce-shared-state` command line option (or `Configuration.WithSharedStateReductionEnabled`).
- Improved support for detecting potential deadlocks during partially controlled concurrency.
- Binary rewriting improvements and fixes.

  The `LogExceptionHandled` method can be used instead for handled exceptions.
- Various other runtime improvements and fixes.

## v1.4.3
- Added support for the `netstandard2.0` target framework.
- Added support for rewriting the non-generic `TaskCompletionSource` type.
- Added support for rewriting the `ValueTask` type (but `IValueTaskSource` is not supported).

- The number of controlled operations are now reported as part of test statistics.
- Improvements, optimizations and bug-fixes in binary rewriting.
- Added support for dumping the rewritten IL diff to a file through `--dump-il-diff`.

## v1.4.1
- Enabled automated fallback to systematic fuzzing upon detecting uncontrolled concurrency during
  testing to increase usability. This feature is enabled by default and can be disabled via the
  `no-fuzzing-fallback` command line option (or
  `Configuration.WithSystematicFuzzingFallbackEnabled`).
- Added a new JSON test report that lists any detected invocations of uncontrolled methods.
- The `TestingEngine.TryEmitTraces` method was renamed to `TestingEngine.TryEmitReports` to reflect
  that the reports do not include only traces.
- The `IActorRuntimeLog.OnStrategyDescription` method was removed.

## v1.4.0
- Redesigned the systematic testing runtime to significantly improve its performance and simplicity.
- An `ActorId` of a halted actor can now be reused.

  resuming interleavings of enabled operations, accordingly.
- Fixed a memory leak in the testing engine.

## v1.3.0
- Improved the binary rewriting engine and fixed various rewriting bugs.
- Removed the deprecated `Microsoft.Coyote.Tasks` namespace. Testing task-based code should now only
  be done via binary rewriting, instead of using a custom task type.
- Removed the `net48` target framework, can instead just use the `net462` target framework for
  legacy .NET Framework projects.

## v1.2.8
- Improved the strategies used for systematic fuzzing.
- Fixed a rewriting bug related to the `TaskAwaiter` type.

## v1.2.7
- Added the `--no-repro` command line option (enabled also via `Configuration.WithNoBugTraceRepro`),
  which disables the ability to reproduce buggy traces to allow skipping errors due to uncontrolled
  concurrency, for example when the program is only partially rewritten, or there is external
  concurrency that is not mocked, or when the program uses an API that is not yet supported.
- The uncontrolled concurrency errors have been updated to be more informative and point to the
  documentation for further reading.

## v1.2.6
- Added an experimental rewriting pass that adds assertion checks to find data races in uses of the
  `System.Collections.Generic.List<T>` and `System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary<TKey, TValue>`
  collections.
- Added support for the `net462` target framework.

## v1.2.5
- Added the `SchedulingPoint` static class that exposes methods for adding manual scheduling points
  during systematic testing.
- Added an experimental systematic testing strategy that uses reinforcement learning. This is
  enabled using the `--sch-rl` command line option or the `Configuration.WithRLStrategy` method.
- Added an experimental systematic fuzzing testing mode that uses delay injection instead of
  systematic testing to find bugs. This can be enabled using the `--systematic-fuzzing` command
  line option or the `Configuration.WithSystematicFuzzingEnabled` method.
- Added the `IActorRuntimeLog.OnEventHandlerTerminated` actor log callback that is called when an
  event handler terminates.
- Fixed a bug where the `IActorRuntimeLog.OnHandleRaisedEvent` actor log callback was not invoked in
  production.

## v1.2.4
- Improved how `coyote test` resolves ambiguous test method names.
- Fixed a bug where awaiting a task from a previous test iteration that was canceled due to
  `ExecutionCanceledException` would hang the tester.

## v1.2.3
- Exposed the `TextWriterLogger` type.
