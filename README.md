Coyote is a cross-platform library and tool for testing concurrent C# code and deterministically reproducing bugs.

Using Coyote, you can easily test the *concurrency* and other *nondeterminism* in your C# code, by
writing what we call a *concurrency unit test*. These look like your regular unit tests, but can
reliably test concurrent workloads (such as actors, tasks, or concurrent requests to ASP.NET
controllers). In regular unit tests, you would typically avoid concurrency due to flakiness, but
with Coyote you are encouraged to embrace concurrency in your tests to find bugs.

Coyote is used by many teams in [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) to test their distributed
systems and services, and has found hundreds of concurrency-related bugs before deploying code
in production and affecting users. In the words of an Azure service architect:
> Coyote found several issues early in the dev process, this sort of issues that would usually bleed
> through into production and become very expensive to fix later.

Coyote is made with :heart: by Microsoft Research.

**New:** Check out our experimental [systematic testing library for
C++](https://github.com/microsoft/cpp-systematic-testing) that is based on the same research and
technology behind Coyote.

## How it works

Consider the following simple test:
```csharp
[Fact]
public async Task TestTask()
{
  int value = 0;
  Task task = Task.Run(() =>
  {
    value = 1;
  });

  Assert.Equal(0, value);
  await task;
}
```

This test will pass most of the time because the assertion will typically execute before the task
starts, but there is one schedule where the task starts fast enough to set `value` to `1` causing
the assertion to fail. Of course, this is a very naive example and the bug is obvious, but you could
imagine much more complicated race conditions that are hidden in complex execution paths.

The way Coyote works, is that you first convert the above test to a concurrency unit test using the
Coyote `TestingEngine` API:
```csharp
using Microsoft.Coyote.SystematicTesting;

[Fact]
public async Task CoyoteTestTask()
{
  var configuration = Configuration.Create().WithTestingIterations(10);
  var engine = TestingEngine.Create(configuration, TestTask);
  engine.Run();
}
```

Next, you run the `coyote rewrite` command from the CLI (typically as a post-build task) to
automatically rewrite the IL of your test and production binaries. This allows Coyote to inject
hooks that take control of the concurrent execution during testing.

You can then run the concurrent unit test from your favorite unit testing framework (such as
[xUnit](https://xunit.net/)). Coyote will take over and repeatedly execute the test from
beginning to the end for N iterations (in the above example N was configured to `10`). Under the
hood, Coyote uses intelligent search strategies to explore all kinds of execution paths that might
hide a bug in each iteration.

The awesome thing is that once a bug is found, Coyote gives you a trace through the `engine.TestReport`
API that you can use to reliably *reproduce* the bug as many times as you want, making debugging and
fixing the issue significantly easier.

## Get started

Getting started with Coyote is easy! First, follow this
[guide](https://microsoft.github.io/coyote/#get-started/install/) to install the `coyote`
command-line tool from [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Coyote/). You are now ready
to check out the Coyote [website](https://microsoft.github.io/coyote/) for tutorials, documentation,
how-tos, samples and more information about the project. Enjoy!
