## Writing program specifications

Coyote makes it easy to design and express system-level specifications that can be asserted during
testing. Specifications come in two forms. _Safety_ specifications assert that the system never
enters a _bad_ state. _Liveness_ specifications assert that the system eventually does something
_good_, that is, it asserts that the system is always able to make progress. These can be written
using a `Monitor`.

### Specifying safety properties

Safety property specifications generalize the notion of source code assertions. A safety property
violation is a finite execution that leads a system to an erroneous state. Coyote provides an API
for writing assertions that specify safety properties that are local to a Coyote actor or task. In
the `Task` programming model, you should use `Specification.Assert` (see [Specification
API](../ref/Microsoft.Coyote.Specifications/Specification.md)) and in the `Actor` programming model
the corresponding API is `Actor.Assert`. In addition, Coyote also provides a way to specify
_global_ assertions that can describe the relationship across tasks or actors.

Coyote provides the notion of a `Monitor` (see [Monitor
API](../ref/Microsoft.Coyote.Specifications/Monitor.md)). It is a special kind of actor that
can receive events but cannot send events to other actors. So it can only observe the execution of
a program but not influence it: a desirable property when writing specifications in code. A
`Monitor` is declared as follows:

```csharp
using Microsoft.Coyote.Specifications;
class GlobalSpec : Monitor { ... }
```

The above code snippet declares a monitor named `GlobalSpec`. Unlike actors, monitors are not
explicitly instantiated. Instead, they need to be registered with the Coyote runtime:

```csharp
ICoyoteRuntime runtime;
runtime.RegisterMonitor<GlobalSpec>();
```

There can only be one instance of a given monitor type. Communication with this monitor happens via
events:

```csharp
ICoyoteRuntime runtime;
runtime.InvokeMonitor<GlobalSpec>(new CustomEvent(...));
```

Just like actors, monitors can have any number of fields, methods and states. The following is a
simple example of a monitor. Let's say that there are two actors `A` and `B` that maintain two
important variables called `x` and `y`, respectively. We want to assert that these two values are
always within a difference of `5` between each other. There is no one assert that we can write that
is local to `A` or `B` because both `x` and `y` live in different places. So we define a global
`Monitor` that accepts events as soon as a variable is updated. Then it keeps asserting their values
are within the required bound.

```csharp
using Microsoft.Coyote.Specifications;

public class UpdatedXEvent : Monitor.Event
{
   public int value { get; private set; }
   public UpdatedXEvent(int value)
   {
         this.value = value;
   }
}

public class UpdatedYEvent : Monitor.Event
{
   public int value { get; private set; }

   public UpdatedYEvent(int value)
   {
         this.value = value;
   }
}

class GlobalSpec : Monitor
{
   // Current reading of x.
   int my_x;
   // Current reading of y.
   int my_y;

   [Start]
   [OnEntry(nameof(InitOnEntry))]
   [OnEventDoAction(typeof(UpdatedXEvent), nameof(UpdatedXAction))]
   [OnEventDoAction(typeof(UpdatedYEvent), nameof(UpdatedYAction))]
   class Init : State { }

   // Initialization.
   void InitOnEntry()
   {
     my_x = my_y = 0;
   }

   void UpdatedXAction(Event e)
   {
      my_x = (e as UpdatedXEvent).value;
      this.AssertSafety();
   }


   void UpdatedYAction(Event e)
   {
      my_y = (e as UpdatedYEvent).value;
      this.AssertSafety();
   }

   void AssertSafety()
   {
      this.Assert(Math.Abs(my_x - my_y) <= 5);
   }
}
```

In general, a monitor maintains local state of its own that is modified in response to events
received from the program. This local state is used to maintain a history of the computation that is
relevant to the property being monitored. An erroneous global behavior is flagged via an assertion
on the private state of the safety monitor. Thus, a monitor cleanly separates the instrumentation
state required for specification (inside the monitor) from the program state (outside the monitor).

You can use monitors with the tasks programming model as well. Simply use
`Specification.RegisterMonitor` and `Specification.InvokeMonitor` instead of the corresponding APIs
in `ICoyoteRuntime`.  A `Task` program can still use an `ICoyoteRuntime` if it wants to, the static
methods are just provided as a convenience way to find the current `ICoyoteRuntime`.

### Specifying liveness properties

Liveness property specifications generalize the notion of _non-termination_. A liveness property
violation is an infinite trace that exhibits lack of progress. Let's explain this concept through an
example. Suppose that you are designing a replication protocol. The job of the protocol is to ensure
that your data is replicated on, say, three different storage nodes. When a storage node fails, the
protocol kicks in, reads the lost data from one of the alive replicas, and then creates a new
replica on a different storage node. A natural specification for this protocol is that _eventually_
it must establish three replicas for the data. In other words, it is unavoidable (on storage-node
failure) that there are less-than-required number of replicas, but in that case the protocol must
work towards creating the desired number of replicas again. A violation of this property is an
(infinite) execution where a storage node fails but the protocol is not able to create the third
replica, even when given an infinite amount of time. We keep talking about infinite behaviors here,
but let's come back to that later. First, let us see how we can write this property as a monitor.

A liveness monitor contains two special states: the _hot_ and the _cold_ state. The hot state
denotes a point in the execution where progress is required, but has not happened yet; e.g. a node
has failed, but a new one has not been created yet. A liveness monitor transitions to the hot state
when it is notified that the system must make progress. A liveness monitor leaves the hot state and
enters the cold state when it is notified that the system has progressed enough. An infinite
execution is erroneous if the liveness monitor stays in the hot state for an infinitely long period
of time. Consider the following example.

```csharp
using Microsoft.Coyote.Specifications;

class UpEvent : Monitor.Event { }
class DownEvent : Monitor.Event { }

class LivenessMonitor : Monitor
{
  // current number of replicas alive.
  int alive = 0;

  [Start]
  [Hot]
  [OnEventDoAction(typeof(UpEvent),nameof(OnUp))]
  [OnEventDoAction(typeof(DownEvent),nameof(OnDown))]
  class NotEnoughReplicas : State { }


  [Cold]
  [OnEventDoAction(typeof(UpEvent),nameof(OnUp))]
  [OnEventDoAction(typeof(DownEvent),nameof(OnDown))]
  class EnoughReplicas : State { }

  // Notification that a new replica is up.
  void OnUp()
  {
     alive++;
     if (alive >= 3)
     {
        this.RaiseGotoStateEvent<EnoughReplicas>();
     }
     else
     {
        this.RaiseGotoStateEvent<NotEnoughReplicas>();
     }
  }

  // Notification that a replica has gone down.
  void OnDown()
  {
     alive--;
     if (alive >= 3)
     {
        this.RaiseGotoStateEvent<EnoughReplicas>();
     }
     else
     {
        this.RaiseGotoStateEvent<NotEnoughReplicas>();
     }
  }
}
```

This monitor has two states. It starts in a _hot_ state `NotEnoughReplicas` and keeps track of the
number of replicas alive in the system. It stays in the `NotEnoughReplicas` state as long as this
number is below three, otherwise it transitions to the _cold_ state `EnoughReplicas`. A program
execution where this monitor gets stuck in the hot state demonstrates a violation of the correctness
property of the replication protocol.

Liveness monitors offer a natural way of describing properties of progress: things that must
_eventually_ happen in the system, where you cannot necessarily say (or its too cumbersome to say)
exactly when the progress will happen. In practice, of course, you cannot wait for infinite
executions: there is only a finite amount of time available to testing. The tester resorts to
heuristics: it considers a sufficiently long and hot execution as a proxy for a liveness violation.
You can configure a bound beyond which executions are considered infinite using the
`--liveness-temperature-threshold` argument on the [coyote tool](../get-started/using-coyote.md).
