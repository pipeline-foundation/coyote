## Build from source

If you plan to contribute a Pull Request to Coyote then you need to be able to build the source code
and run the tests.

the github repo</a>

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 6.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet)

**Optional:**

- [Visual Studio 2019](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/install-visual-studio)
on Windows.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) is handy to have on other platforms.

### Building the Coyote project

Clone the [Coyote repo](http://github.com/microsoft/coyote), then open `Coyote.sln` and build.

You can also use the following `PowerShell` command line from a Visual Studio 2019 Developer
Command Prompt:

```plain
powershell -f Scripts/build.ps1
```

### Building the NuGet packages

In the Coyote project run this `PowerShell` command line from a Visual Studio 2019 Developer
Command Prompt:

```plain
powershell -f .\Scripts\create-nuget-packages.ps1
```

### Installing the Coyote command line tool package

You can install the `coyote` tool from this locally built package using:

```plain
dotnet tool install --global --add-source ./bin/nuget Microsoft.Coyote.CLI
```

To update your version of the tool you will have to first uninstall the previous version using:

```plain
dotnet tool uninstall --global Microsoft.Coyote.CLI
```

### Using a local NuGet package

The samples use the published Microsoft.Coyote NuGet package by default. If you want the samples to
use the same Coyote bits you built from the Coyote repo, then edit the NuGet.config file and
uncomment the following line:

```xml
<add key="Coyote" value="../Coyote/bin/nuget"/>
```

Now you can rebuild the samples and so long as the `Common\version.props` file contains the same
version in both `coyote` and `coyote-samples` then it will pick up your newly created NuGet package
and use that. Note: this can make debugging into the Coyote runtime possible.

Now you are ready to [start using Coyote](using-coyote.md).

### Running the tests

To run all available tests, execute the following `PowerShell` command line from a Visual Studio
2019 Developer Command Prompt:

```plain
powershell -f Scripts/run-tests.ps1
```

You can also run a specific category of tests by adding the `-test` option to specify the category
name, for example:

```plain
powershell -f Scripts/run-tests.ps1 -test core
```
