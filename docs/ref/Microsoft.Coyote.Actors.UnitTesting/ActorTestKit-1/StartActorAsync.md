# ActorTestKit&lt;T&gt;.StartActorAsync method

Initializes the actor, passes the optional specified event and invokes its on-entry handler, if there is one available. This method returns a task that completes when the actor reaches quiescence (typically when the event handler finishes executing because there are not more events to dequeue, or when the actor asynchronously waits to receive an event). If the actor is a state machine it also transitions the actor to its start state.

```csharp
public Task StartActorAsync(Event initialEvent = null)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| initialEvent | Optional event used during initialization. |

## Return Value

Task that represents the asynchronous operation.
