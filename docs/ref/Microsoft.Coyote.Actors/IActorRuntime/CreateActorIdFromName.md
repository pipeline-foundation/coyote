# IActorRuntime.CreateActorIdFromName method

Creates a actor id that is uniquely tied to the specified unique name. The returned actor id can either be a fresh id (not yet bound to any actor), or it can be bound to a previously created actor. In the second case, this actor id can be directly used to communicate with the corresponding actor.

```csharp
public ActorId CreateActorIdFromName(Type type, string name)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| type | Type of the actor. |
| name | Unique name used to create or get the actor id. |

## Return Value
