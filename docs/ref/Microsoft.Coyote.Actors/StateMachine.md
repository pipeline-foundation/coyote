| [CurrentState](StateMachine/CurrentState.md) { get; } | Gets the Type of the current state. |
| override [OnEventHandledAsync](StateMachine/OnEventHandledAsync.md)(…) | Asynchronous callback that is invoked when the actor finishes handling a dequeued event, unless the handler of the dequeued event raised an event or caused the actor to halt (either normally or due to an exception).

| [RaiseGotoStateEvent&lt;TState&gt;](StateMachine/RaiseGotoStateEvent.md)() | Raise a special event that performs a goto state operation at the end of the current action. |
| [RaiseHaltEvent](StateMachine/RaiseHaltEvent.md)() | Raises a [`HaltEvent`](./HaltEvent.md) to halt the actor at the end of the current action. |
| [RaisePopStateEvent](StateMachine/RaisePopStateEvent.md)() | Raise a special event that performs a pop state operation at the end of the current action. |
| [RaisePushStateEvent](StateMachine/RaisePushStateEvent.md)(…) | Raise a special event that performs a push state operation at the end of the current action. |
