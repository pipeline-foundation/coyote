# StateMachine.OnEventHandledAsync method

Asynchronous callback that is invoked when the actor finishes handling a dequeued event, unless the handler of the dequeued event raised an event or caused the actor to halt (either normally or due to an exception). Unless this callback raises an event, the actor will either become idle or dequeue the next event from its inbox.

```csharp
protected override Task OnEventHandledAsync(Event e)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| e | The event that was handled. |
