Asynchronously pauses the currently executing operation until the operation with the specified id completes. If *resumeAsynchronously* is set to true, then after the asynchronous pause, a new operation will be created to execute the continuation.

```csharp
public static PausedOperationAwaitable PauseUntilAsync(Func<bool> condition, 
    bool resumeAsynchronously = false)
```
