# SchedulingPoint.SetCheckpoint method

Sets a checkpoint in the execution path that is so far explored during the current test iteration. This will capture all controlled scheduling and nondeterministic decisions taken until the checkpoint and the testing engine will then try to replay the same decisions in subsequent iterations before performing any new exploration.

```csharp
public static void SetCheckpoint()
```

## Remarks

Only a single checkpoint can be set at a time, and invoking this method with an existing checkpoint will either extend it with new decisions, or overwrite it if the new checkpoint diverges or is empty.
