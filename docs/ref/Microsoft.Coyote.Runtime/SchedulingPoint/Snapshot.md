# SchedulingPoint.Snapshot method

Takes a snapshot of all controlled scheduling and nondeterministic decisions taken during the current test iteration. The testing engine will then try to replay the same decisions in subsequent iterations before performing any new exploration.

```csharp
public static void Snapshot()
```

## Remarks

Only a single snapshot can be stored at a time, and invoking this method with an existing snapshot will either extend its suffix if new decisions are taken, or overwrite it if the new snapshot diverges or is empty.
