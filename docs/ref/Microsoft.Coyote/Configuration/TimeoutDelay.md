# Configuration.TimeoutDelay property

Value that controls the probability of triggering a timeout during systematic testing. Decrease the value to increase the frequency of timeouts (e.g. a value of 1 corresponds to a 50% probability), or increase the value to decrease the frequency (e.g. a value of 10 corresponds to a 10% probability).

```csharp
public uint TimeoutDelay { get; }
```
