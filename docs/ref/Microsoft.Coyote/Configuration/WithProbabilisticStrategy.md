# Configuration.WithProbabilisticStrategy method

Updates the configuration to use the probabilistic exploration strategy during systematic testing. You can specify a value controlling the probability of each scheduling decision. This value is specified as the integer N in the equation 0.5 to the power of N. So for N=1, the probability is 0.5, for N=2 the probability is 0.25, N=3 you get 0.125, etc. By default, this value is 3.

```csharp
public Configuration WithProbabilisticStrategy(uint probabilityLevel = 3)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| probabilityLevel | The probability level. |

## Remarks

Note that explicitly setting this strategy disables the default exploration mode that uses a tuned portfolio of strategies.
