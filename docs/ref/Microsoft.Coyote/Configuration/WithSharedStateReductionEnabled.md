# Configuration.WithSharedStateReductionEnabled method

Updates the configuration with shared state reduction enabled or disabled. If this reduction strategy is enabled, then the runtime will attempt to reduce the schedule space by taking into account any 'READ' and 'WRITE' operations declared by invoking [`Read`](../../Microsoft.Coyote.Runtime/SchedulingPoint/Read.md) and [`Write`](../../Microsoft.Coyote.Runtime/SchedulingPoint/Write.md).

```csharp
public Configuration WithSharedStateReductionEnabled(bool isEnabled = true)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| isEnabled | If true, then shared state reduction is enabled. |
