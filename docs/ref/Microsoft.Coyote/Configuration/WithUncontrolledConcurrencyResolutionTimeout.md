# Configuration.WithUncontrolledConcurrencyResolutionTimeout method

Updates the values that control how much time the runtime should wait for each instance of uncontrolled concurrency to resolve before continuing exploration. The *attempts* parameter controls how many times to check if uncontrolled concurrency has resolved, whereas the *delay* parameter controls how long the runtime waits between each retry.

```csharp
public Configuration WithUncontrolledConcurrencyResolutionTimeout(uint attempts, uint delay)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| attempts | The number of attempts, which by default is 10. |
| delay | The delay value is the number of busy loops to perform, which by default is 1000. |

## Remarks

Increasing each of the values allows more time to try resolve uncontrolled concurrency at the cost of slower testing.
