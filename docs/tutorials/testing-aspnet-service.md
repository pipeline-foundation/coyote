## Systematically testing an ASP.NET service

This sample shows how to use Coyote to **systematically test** an ASP.NET service. The sample
ASP.NET service included here implements a simple **image gallery**. Please note that this sample
service contains some interesting *bugs* on purpose. You can run the unit tests with and without
Coyote and you can run the web front end using the Azure storage emulators.

## What you will need

You will also need to:

- Install [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).
- Install the [.NET 7.0 version of the coyote tool](../get-started/install.md).
- Be familiar with the `coyote` tool. See [using Coyote](../get-started/using-coyote.md).
- Clone the [Coyote git repo](http://github.com/microsoft/coyote).

If you want to actually run the sample (rather than just running the unit tests) then you will also
need the following:

- [Azure Storage
Emulator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-emulator) must be
installed and running.
- [Azure Cosmos
Emulator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/local-emulator?tabs=cli%2Cssl-netstd21)
must be installed and running.
- Open Azure Cosmos Data Explorer from taskbar tray and copy the `Primary Connection String` from
there into `~/ImageGalleryAspNet/ImageGalleryService/appsettings.json`.

## Build the sample

After cloning the [Coyote](http://github.com/microsoft/coyote) git repo run the following command:

```
cd Samples/WebApps/ImageGalleryAspNet/
dotnet build
```

## Optional: deploying and running the sample locally

You do not need to do this unless you really want to, you can do all the unit testing using Coyote
without running the development version of the service. But some people like to see the code running
before they think about how to test it.

Once all the above prerequisites are complete (including the storage emulators) you can run this app
using two separate console windows as follows:

```shell
cd ImageGalleryService
dotnet run
```

And in the second window:

```shell
cd ImageGallery
dotnet run
```

Navigate your web browser to `http://localhost:5000/` and you will see the empty ImageGallery site.
Create a new test account and upload some of your favorite photos (you can do more than one at a
time) and you will see them appear. The "dotnet run" consoles will also show logging output that
shows you what is happening behind the scenes.

## Sample structure

The `ImageGallery.sln` solution consists of five projects (all will be discussed below):

- `ImageGallery` - this is the web front end that uses the API service.
- `ImageGalleryService` - this is the ASP.NET API service.
- `ImageGalleryClient` - a helper API for talking to the service.
- `Tests` - this contains two regular unit tests that use `MSTest`.
- `Tests.Coyote` - this invokes the two tests in `Tests` wrapping them with the Coyote testing
  engine.
- `TraceReplayer` - makes it easy to reproduce the bugs found by `coyote test`.

## The Image Gallery sample service

This service is based on a 3-tier architecture: (1) a client (implemented by the unit tests and by
the ImageGallery web front end), (2) two ASP.NET API services, one for managing accounts
(`AccountController`) and one for managing image galleries (`GalleryController`) associated with
these accounts, and (3) two backend storage systems used by these API services (Cosmos DB to
store accounts, and Azure Blob Storage to store images).

The `AccountController` has 4 APIs to `Create`, `Update`, `Get` and `Delete` an account. `Create`
first checks if the account already exists, and if not it creates it in Cosmos DB. Similarly,
`Update` and `Get` first check if the account exists and, if it does, it updates it, or returns it,
accordingly. Finally, `Delete` first checks if the account exists, and if it does it deletes it from
Cosmos DB and then also deletes the associated image container for this account from Azure Blob
Storage.

The `GalleryController` is similar. It has 4 APIs: `Store`, `Get`, `Delete` `GetList`. `Store`
first checks if the account already exists in Cosmos DB and, if it does, it stores the image in
Azure Blob Storage. `Get` is simple, it checks if the image blob exists, if it it does, it returns
the image. Finally, `Delete` first checks if the account already exists in Cosmos DB and, if it
does, it deletes the image blob from Azure Blob Storage. `GetList` can be used to enumerate
the images in an account in pages.

## Bugs in the service

As mentioned above, this service was designed in purpose to contain some interesting bugs to
showcase systematic testing with Coyote. You can read the comments in the controllers for more
details about the bugs, but briefly a lot of the above APIs have race conditions. For example, the
controller checks that the account exists, and tries to update it, but another request could delete
the account between those two operations, resulting in an unhandled exception, and thus a 500
internal server error, which is a bad bug. The service should never return a 500 to its users!

These kind of bugs involving race conditions between concurrent requests are hard to test. Unit
tests are typically tailored to test sequential programs. Async race conditions can result in flaky
tests and when you start debugging them, adding break points, and diving in, the race condition
might just disappear, something known as a [Heisenbug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisenbug)!

We wrote two unit tests (using `MSTest` and `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing`) to exercise the
service and uncover bugs: `TestConcurrentAccountRequests` and
`TestConcurrentAccountAndImageRequests`. The former only tests the `AccountController`, while the
later tests both controllers at the same time. You can read more details in the comments for these
tests, but let us quickly summarize what these tests do and what the bugs are.

The `TestConcurrentAccountRequests` method initializes the mocks and injects them into the ASP.NET
service, then creates a client, which does a `Create` account request to create a new account for
Alice. It waits for this request to complete. It then *concurrently* invokes two requests: `Update`
account and `Delete` account, and waits for both to complete. These requests are now racing, and
because there is a race condition in the `AccountController` controller logic, the update request
can fail due to an unhandled exception (500 error code) and this failure is nondeterministic. The
issue is that the controller first checks if the account exists and, if it does, it then updates
it. But after the "does account exists check", the delete request could run, deleting the account!
The update then tries to run which triggers the bug! Interestingly the non-coyote test run rarely
finds this bug although it is possible to see it with teh ImageGallery web front end if you use 
multiple browser windows and do batch upload and delete operations in each.

The `TestConcurrentAccountAndImageRequests` initializes the mocks and injects them into the ASP.NET
service, then creates a client, which does a `Create` account request to create a new account for
Alice. It waits for this request to complete. It then *concurrently* invokes two requests: `Store`
image and `Delete` account, and waits for both to complete. Similar to the above test, these
requests are now racing, and because there is a race condition in the controller logic, the store
request can nondeterministically store the image in an "orphan" container in Azure Storage, even
if the associated account was deleted. This is more subtle bug because the request itself is not
throwing an unhandled exception, it is just a sneaky race when trying to read/write from/to two
backend systems at the same time. This issue is also a data race and you can see the detail in the
controller logic.

Most of the bugs described in this tutorial (and in the comments in the service code) can be fixed
by catching the exceptions thrown by the (mock) storage systems (or checking their returned error
codes) and returning back an appropriate non-500 error code to the client. Some of the bugs might
also require to implement roll back logic in the case where a request updates one or more storage
accounts in a non-transactional manner, which could result in stale data being stored, even if the
the request failed.

Before going further (and into Coyote), lets build and run the tests!

## How to run the unit tests

Just run them from inside Visual Studio, or run the following:

```
cd Samples/WebApps/ImageGalleryAspNet/
dotnet test bin/net7.0/ImageGalleryTests.dll
```

The tests may or may not trigger the bug! Most likely you will see this output:

```
Total tests: 2
     Passed: 2
 Total time: 1.2053 Seconds
```

And even if you do get them to fail, if you try to debug them, the bugs may or may not manifest (as
they are [Heizenbugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisenbug)). We surely want some better way of
testing concurrent code, right?

## Coyote is here to help

You can learn more about the systematic testing capabilities of Coyote
[here](../concepts/concurrency-unit-testing.md), but lets give a brief summary here to get quickly in action.

Coyote serializes the execution of a concurrent program (i.e., only executes a single task at at
time). A Coyote test executes this serialized program lots of times (called testing iterations),
each time exploring different interleavings in a clever manner. If a bug is found, Coyote gives a
trace that allows you to deterministically reproduce the bug. You can use the VS Debugger to go over
the trace as many times as required to fix the bug.

To be able to test this service, use Coyote's binary rewriting capabilities to instrument
concurrency primitives (learn more about this [here](../get-started/using-coyote.md)). This is
handled by the build script above.

## How to run the Coyote systematic tests

Please do not run the MSTest from inside Visual Studio, as it will currently run the un-rewritten
binaries (requires a post build task to get around this). Instead, once you build the service and
the tests, run the following from the root directory of the repo:

```
coyote rewrite rewrite.coyote.json
dotnet test bin/coyote/ImageGalleryTests.Coyote.dll
```

This will [rewrite](../concepts/binary-rewriting.md) the tests, and then run the tests inside the
Coyote testing engine, up to 1000 iterations each, and report any found bugs. The bug should be
found most of the time after just a few iterations (as they are not too deep).

Besides the error output, you should see a bug error such as:
```
X TestConcurrentAccountRequests [10s 407ms]
  Error Message:
   Assert.Fail failed. Found bug: Found unexpected error code.
   Replay trace using Coyote by running:
     TraceReplayer.exe TestConcurrentAccountRequests TestConcurrentAccountRequests.trace
```

Which also tells you how to reliably reproduce the bug using Coyote.

## How to reproduce a buggy concurrent trace

As you can see above, the `TestConcurrentAccountRequests` failed. This bug is nondeterministic, and
if you try debug it without Coyote it might not always happen. However, Coyote gives you a reliable
repro. Right now, someone can use the replay functionality from the `coyote replay` tool or
programmatically through the replay API, but for the purposes of this sample there is a simple
`TraceReplayer` executable that takes the name of the test and the trace file produced by Coyote,
and replays it in the VS debugger. To do this, just invoke the command mentioned in the error above
(change the paths to the ones on your machine):
```
cd bin/coyote
TraceReplayer.exe TestConcurrentAccountRequests TestConcurrentAccountRequests.trace
```

You will also see that the trace output contains logs such as:

```text
[0HM34OD7O65E5] Creating account with id '0' (name: 'alice', email: 'alice@coyote.com').
[0HM34OD7O65E5] Creating container 'Accounts' in database 'ImageGalleryDB' if it does not exist.
[0HM34OD7O65E5] Checking if item with partition key '0' and id '0' exists in container 'Accounts'.
[0HM34OD7O65E5] Creating new item with partition key '0' and id '0' in container 'Accounts'.
[0HM34OD7O65E7] Storing image with name 'beach' and account id '0'.
[0HM34OD7O65E6] Deleting account with id '0'.
[0HM34OD7O65E6] Creating container 'Accounts' in database 'ImageGalleryDB' if it does not exist.
[0HM34OD7O65E7] Creating container 'Accounts' in database 'ImageGalleryDB' if it does not exist.
[0HM34OD7O65E7] Checking if item with partition key '0' and id '0' exists in container 'Accounts'.
[0HM34OD7O65E6] Checking if item with partition key '0' and id '0' exists in container 'Accounts'.
[0HM34OD7O65E6] Deleting item with partition key '0' and id '0' in container 'Accounts'.
[0HM34OD7O65E7] Creating container 'gallery-0' if it does not exist.
[0HM34OD7O65E6] Deleting container 'gallery-0' if it exists.
[0HM34OD7O65E7] Creating blob 'beach' in container 'gallery-0'.
```

In the above logs, the `[0HM34OD7O65E5]` prefix is the `HttpContext.TraceIdentifier` which is a
unique id per HTTP request. This makes it easier to see how Coyote explores lots of async
interleaving during testing and debugging. In this example you can see it bouncing between 3 async
tasks `[0HM34OD7O65E5]`, `[0HM34OD7O65E6]` and `[0HM34OD7O65E7]` and this controlled interleaving
of tasks can help find lots of bugs.

## Troubleshooting

**Login fails with an unhandled exception has occurred while executing the request.**

Make sure the Azure storage emulators are running. 

**SocketException: No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it.**

Make sure the Azure storage emulators are running. 

**System.AggregateException: 'Retry failed after 6 tries**

Make sure the Azure storage emulators are running. Make sure you can then connect to the azure
storage emulator from the Azure storage `explorer`.
